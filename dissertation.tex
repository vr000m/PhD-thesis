\draftabstract{

The deployment of WebRTC and telepresence systems is going to start wide-scale
adoption of high quality real-time communication. Delivering high quality
video usually corresponds to an increase in required network capacity and also
requires an assurance of network stability. A real-time multimedia application
that uses the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) over UDP needs to implement
congestion control since UDP does not implement any such mechanism. This
thesis is about enabling congestion control for real-time communication and
deploying it on the public Internet containing a mixture of wired and wireless
links.

A congestion control algorithm relies on congestion cues, such as RTT and
loss. Hence, in this thesis, we first propose a framework for classifying
congestion cues. We classify the congestion cues as a combination of: where
they are measured or observed? And, how is the sending endpoint notified?  For
each there are two options, i.e., the cues are either observed and reported by
an in-path or by an off-path source, and, the cue is either reported in-band
or out-of-band, which results in four combinations. Hence, the framework
provides options to look at congestion cues beyond those reported by the
receiver.

We propose a sender-driven, a receiver-driven and a hybrid congestion control
algorithm. The hybrid algorithm relies on both the sender and receiver co-
operating to perform congestion control. Lastly, we compare the performance of
these different algorithms. We also explore the idea of using capacity
notifications from middleboxes (e.g., 3G/LTE base stations) along the path as
cues for a congestion control algorithm. Further, we look at the interaction
between error-resilience mechanisms and show that FEC can be used in a
congestion control algorithm for probing for additional capacity.

We propose Multipath RTP (MPRTP) an extension to RTP, which uses multiple
paths for either aggregating capacity or for increasing error-resilience.  We
show that our proposed scheduling algorithm works in diverse scenarios (e.g.,
3G and WLAN, 3G and 3G, etc.) with paths with varying latencies.

Lastly, we propose a network coverage map service (NCMS), which aggregates
throughput measurements from mobile users consuming multimedia services. The
NCMS sends notifications to its subscribers about the upcoming network
conditions, which take these notifications into account when performing
congestion control.

In order to test and refine the ideas presented in this thesis, we have
implemented most of them in proof-of-concept prototypes, and conducted
experiments and simulations to validate our assumptions and gain new insights.

%% Preface
% If you write this somewhere else than in Helsinki, use the optional location.
\begin{preface}[Espoo]

This dissertation is based on several years of research at Aalto University
(erstwhile Helsinki University of Technology) and standardization at the
Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). My sincere thanks to all the people
who helped me with my research. Foremost, I would like to thank Prof. JÃ¶rg Ott
for encouraging me to pursue the interaction of multimedia and congestion
control in more detail. He is an outstanding guide, his timely interactions
kept spirits high when faced with disappointments and for his patience to stay
the course. An equal measure of gratitude is due to all my co-authors. 

% First, Igor Curcio of Nokia Research Center for introducing me to the
% challenges faced by multimedia on mobile devies. 
% Saba Ahsan for helping with the design of the Multipath RTP scheduling
% algorithm.
