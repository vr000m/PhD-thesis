Figure~\ref{fig:4:fw} in Chapter~\ref{chap:cc.fw} shows the structure of the
congestion control framework described in this thesis. The framework
categorizes \emph{In-path} sources and \emph{out-of-band} signaling for
implementing congestion control, which are discussed in this chapter. This
chapter is based on our work on Multipath RTP (MPRTP), which is documented in
\citepub{c:mprtp}, in \cite{draft.mprtp}, \cite{draft.mprtp.sdp},
\cite{Globisch:AsymGrpComm}, and \cite{draft.rtcp.overlay}.

In \citepub{c:mprtp}, we propose the following: design goals of implement a
multipath protocol for multimedia, protocol details, scheduling algorithm to
send media packets over multiple paths, a dejitter buffer implementation to
playout packets smoothly even when the path skew is high. We evaluate the
performance of the proposed mechanisms in diverse scenarios in our testbed.
Lastly, we discuss the system consideration for deployment.
