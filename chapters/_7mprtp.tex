Figure~\ref{fig:4:fw} in Chapter~\ref{chap:cc.fw} shows the structure of the
congestion control framework described in this thesis. The framework
categorizes \emph{In-path} sources and \emph{out-of-band} signaling for
implementing congestion control, which are discussed in this chapter. This
chapter is based on our work on congestion control for interactive multimedia
applications, which is documented in \citepub{c:3grc} and \citepub{c:glass}.
