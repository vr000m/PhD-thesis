Figure~\ref{fig:4:fw} in Chapter~\ref{chap:cc.fw} shows the structure of the
congestion control framework described in this thesis. The framework
categorizes \emph{In-path} and \emph{Out-of-path} sources and
\emph{out-of-band} signaling for implementing congestion control, which are
discussed in this chapter. This chapter is based on our work on congestion
control for interactive multimedia applications, which is documented in
\citepub{c:3grc}, \citepub{c:glass}.
