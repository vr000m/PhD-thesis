In this thesis, we describe our proposed congestion control framework in
\ref{fw.fw}. When describing the different parts of the framework, we also
discuss the related work and our contributions in those areas. In
Chapter~\ref{chap:rg}, we aimed to classify congestion control cues for
real-time communication based on: \emph{where they are measured?} (by in-path
or out-of-path sources) and \emph{how they are reported?} (via in-band or
out-of-band signaling). In Chapter~\ref{chap:fw}, we describe other
fundamental choices needed to implement congestion control. Choice of
congestion cues, reporting frequency and circuit-breakers. Additionally, we
also describe an evaluation suite for measuring the performance of the
proposed congestion control algorithms.

In chapter~\ref{chap:cc}, we describe congestion control implemented using
congestion cues from in-band sources and signaled in path (in RTCP). We
further categorize the congestion control algorithms based on \emph{where they
are implemented}: sender-driven, receiver-driven, or co-operative (combination
of sender and receiver) and compare the performance of each.
