In the forthcoming deployment of WebRTC systems, we speculate that high
quality\footnote{normally, corresponds to increase in required bandwidth}
video confrencing will see wide adoption. Normally, to assure stability of the
network (and avoid congestion collapse), these real-time communication systems
will need to implement some kind of congestion control for their RTP-based
media traffic.

RTP transmits the media data over IP using a variety of transport layer
protocols such as UDP, TCP, and Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP).
Consequetly, congestion control for RTP-based media flows can be implemented
either in the application or the media flows are transmitted over congestion-%
controlled transport (TCP or DCCP). While using a congestion controlled
transport may be safe for the network, it is suboptimal for the media quality
unless the congestion-controlled transport is designed to carry media flows or
operates in a very low latency network ($<100$ms)~\cite{Brosh:tcp-real-time}.
On the other hand, using a non-congestion controlled transport (e.g., UDP),
the rate-adaptation is implemented in the application.  In this thesis, we
consider congestion control for unicast RTP traffic running over best-effort
IP network.

% CC should not cause queuing delay. Or define low-latency operation of
% multimedia cc.

Endpoints rely on RTCP feedback from the receiver to implement congestion
control. Hence, the design of congestion control algorithm needs to be aware
of the limits on the timing of the feedback. Normally congestion control
requires a tight control loop, which means that the receiving endpoint should
be able to provide feedback at very short intervals. For example in TCP, the
receiver sends an \emph{acknowledgement} packet in response to every packet
(or every few packets) it receives. Whereas, RTCP encourages infrequent
feedback and specifies an upper-bound on the fraction of the session media
bitrate that the feedback packets can use\footnote{The specified feedback rate
is $5\%$ for each multimedia session}. Hence, the congestion control should
take into 3 aspects into its design: congestion cues to report, block size of
each report, and frequency of these feedback reports.

but unlike other delay-based variants of TCP there
may not be sufficient RTCP bandwidth to provide feedback on a per-packet
basis~\cite{draft.rmcat.feedback}.
