\section{Structure of the Thesis}

This thesis describes techniques to adapt media to changing network
characteristics for different types of multimedia systems. The work is mainly
a summary of scientific-papers, but is also supported by additional body of
work. We have co-authored a number of Internet Drafts\footnote{at the time of
writing, several of these are still in the ID state, but will be published as
RFCs (Request for Comments) shortly} that complement the  sceintific results
discussed in the thesis. The chapters describing the various parts of the
congestion control framework discuss both our scientific and engineering work,
while associating it with the pertinent related work in the area. The
remainder of the thesis is organized as follows.

Chapter~\ref{chap2} discribes the research goal of the thesis, which consists
of creating a framework for congestion control that meets the  requirements
for multimedia systems.

Chapter~\ref{chap3} provides the neccessary background information to RTP
(Real-time Transport Protocol).

Chapter~\ref{chap4}

Chapter~\ref{chap5}

Chapter~\ref{chap6}

Chapter~\ref{chap7}

Chapter~\ref{chap8} concludes the thesis and we analyse if the framework meets
the requirements.
