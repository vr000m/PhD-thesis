In recent years, video has emerged as the dominant traffic\footnote{In 2012,
$51\%$ of mobile traffic was video.} on the Internet~\cite{cvni.13,dawn.zb},
partly due to the success of YouTube and other over-the-top media streaming
services. Video streaming emerged as a dominant traffic after it was easily
accessible to Internet users in the web-browser (initially, due to the Adobe
Flash Video plugin and later, due to HTML5 video tag). Currently, the same
trend can be observed with interactive multimedia, i.e., web services can use
Adobe's Real-time Media Flow Protocol (RTMFP)~\cite{draft.rtmfp} or HTML5's
Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC)~\cite{draft.webrtc}.

Real-time multimedia traffic on the Internet is subject to the
unpredictability of the best-effort IP network. This uncertainity is mainly
due to packet loss, packet re-ordering, variable queuing delay. Buffer-
bloat~\cite{gettys:bufferbloat} and drop-tail queues in the router may cause
long delays and bursty losses. Video streaming overcomes most of these
challenges by having larger playout buffers, but some over-the-top streaming
applications now use TCP instead of UDP for delivering media data.
Unfortunately, TCP is only suitable for interactive multimedia for paths with
very low end-to-end delay ($<100$ms)~\cite{Brosh:tcp-real-time}. Furthermore,
in video streaming, if the path characteristics change, the client can switch
between files with the same media content pre-encoded at different quality
levels. However, this strategy is not applicable to interactive multimedia,
where the sending endpoint needs to immediately adapt the media encoding rate
to the available path capacity.

%Compared to video streaming, video communication is more challenging. First,
%it requires implementing a NAT traversal mechanism for communicating between
%peers that may be behind a NATs or firewalls. Second, it requires agreeing on
%a set of common codecs, protocols and formats to avoid negotiation failure.
%Lastly, to provide  a decent end-user experience, it requires either the end-
%point or a classifier to associate a DiffServ Code Point (DSCP) to the media
%packets; therby, enabling Quality of Service (QoS). Additionally, it should be
%able to adapt the media quality to the end-to-end path characteristics.

This thesis is about enabling congestion control for real-time multimedia. The
idea was to build a congestion control that takes into account the network
conditions, media codec capabilities and the demands of the multimedia
application. Additionally, the congestion control can adjust to the user's
preferences, changes in application policy/settings and by monitoring the
user's Quality of Experience (QoE). In chapter~\ref{chap2} we discuss the
requirements for congestion control, define a framework and categorize
congestion control cues.


In this thesis we use Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP)~\cite{rfc3550} to
carry media data, the congestion control algorithm is therefore built within
the constraints of RTP. Consequently, wherever possible we have attempted to
fix these deficiencies by standardizing our proposed extensions to RTP. This
thesis is a bundle of scientific papers that discuss various parts of the
framework and this summary puts them in context.

\section{Research Methodology}

This thesis aimed to produce original scientific work that would be widely
applicable in the Internet community. Based on the cultural styles defined by
ACM~\cite{Denning:CS.Method}, we use the \textit{abstraction} and
\textit{design} paradigms to conduct our scientific research. To elaborate,
the results that make up the core of the thesis were implemented as
simulations, proof-of-concept prototypes and in test-beds. Consequently, this
process helped us make better design and implementation decisions.

In order to make significant impact in the Internet community, researchers not
only have to produce significant results to motivate deployment but also solve
engineering issues. These engineering solutions may not fulfill the
requirements of being described in scientific papers, but are instead
described in standards documents, which facilitates interoperability and
enthuses deployment. For example, the protocol extensions to enable congestion
control (i.e., to signal the congestion cues) are discussed mainly in the
standards document, while the associated congestion control algorithm and the
performance analysis is discussed in the scientifc papers. To summarize, in
this thesis, we discuss both our research work and our engineering work, but
emphasize more on the former.



\section{Structure of the Thesis}

This thesis describes techniques to adapt media to changing network
characteristics for different types of multimedia systems. The work is mainly
a summary of scientific-papers, but is also supported by additional body of
work. We have co-authored a number of Internet Drafts\footnote{at the time of
writing, several of these are still in the ID state, but will be published as
RFCs (Request for Comments) shortly} that complement the  sceintific results
discussed in the thesis. The chapters describing the various parts of the
congestion control framework discuss both our scientific and engineering work,
while associating it with the relevant related work in the area. The remainder
of the thesis is organized as follows.

Chapter~\ref{chap2} discribes the research goal of the thesis, which consists
of creating a framework for congestion control that meets the requirements for
multimedia systems.

%\chapter{RTP: Real-time Transport Protocol}

Chapter~\ref{chap3} provides the neccessary background information to Real-
time Transport Protocol (RTP). RTP together with RTP Control Protocol (RTCP)
forms the control loop that adapts media to the reported path characteristics.
We also provide an high-level overview to our proposed `Congestion Cues
Framework' and discuss criteria for evaluating congestion control for
multimedia systems. This section is based on the RTP protocol
suite~\cite{rfc3550, rfc4585, rfc3611, rfc5104, rfc5506} and our contributions
to it~\cite{draft.rmcat.evaluate, draft.xr.discard.rle, draft.xr.jb}.

Chapter~\ref{chap4} discusses the mechanisms available for congestion control
in interactive multimedia. We also discuss the circuit breaker--a minimal
congestion control--conditions under which a multimedia stream will be
terminated. The chapter is based on our contributions, which is documented
in~\cite{draft.rtp.cb, Singh:control.loops.api}, \citepub{c:cb},

% \chapter{Multihoming, Overlay and Mobility Consideration}

Chapter~\ref{chap5} discusses using multihoming for real-time media delivery
and introduces Multipath RTP (MPRTP). The chapter is mainly based on our
contributions, which is documented in~\cite{draft.mprtp, draft.mprtp.sdp,
Globisch:AsymGrpComm, draft.rtcp.overlay}, and \citepub{c:mprtp}.

% \chapter{Network-assisted Congestion Control}

Chapter~\ref{chap6} discusses using congestion cues from coverage maps, i.e.,
overlay coverage or througput information (collected by active/passive
measurements) on a geographical map. The chapter is based on our
contributions,  which is documented in \citepub{c:glass}.

% \chapter{Adaptive Error-Resilience and Congestion Control}
% +ECN

Chapter~\ref{chap7} discusses the mechanisms available for error-resilience of
interactive video. We also discuss using these error-resilience techniques for
congestion control. The chapter is based on our contributions, which is
documented in \citepub{c:err}, and \citepub{c:fecrc}.

% \chapter{Conclusions}

Chapter~\ref{chap8} concludes the thesis and we analyse if the framework meets
the requirements.
