Error-resilience is typically a topic discussed orthogonally to congestion
control and the main reason is that, error-resilience caters to handling
packet loss while congestion control caters to the amount of information sent
over the network. This chapter is based on our work on unifying
error-resilience and congestion control.

In \citepub{c:err}, we evaluate the performance of the various
error-resilience schemes available for use in interactive multimedia
communication (mainly applicable to H.264). These are: using Negative
Acknowledgement (NACK) or Packet Loss Indication (PLI), Forward Error
Correction (FEC) or Unequal Level of Protection (ULP), adaptive slice sizes,
and Reference Pictures Selection Indication (RPSI). We evaluate the
performance of the proposed mechanisms in diverse scenarios in a simulated
environment (in ns-2) using real-world 3G loss patterns~\cite{3gppSim}.
Lastly, based on our observations, we define the applicability of the various
error-resilience with respect to end-to-end latency and packet loss.

In \citepub{c:fecrc}, we propose using FEC not only for error-resilience but
also for congestion control. Instead of probing for available capacity by
increasing the sending rate of the media flow, we propose introducing
redundancy. If a packet gets lost and the added FEC packet arrives in time the
receiving endpoint would recover the lost packet. However, if the packet is
not lost, by introducing the FEC packet the sender not only discovers that
there is additional available capacity, but also has a sense of the magnitude
(at minimum) of the available capacity. We compare our proposal with our
previous work in \citepub{c:3grc} and \citepub{c:hetrc}, and Google's
congestion control~\cite{draft.rrtcc}. We evaluate the performance of the
mechanisms in diverse scenarios implemented in a simulation environment (in
ns-2) and in our testbed.

\section{Error-resilience Schemes}
% explain all 4 and the adaptivity

H.264~\cite{h264} uses various error-control methods~\cite{err_res_h264_std,
wang98error, wang00review, 310669} to overcome loss due to bit-error
corruption (e.g., in wireless) and non-bursty packet loss (e.g., due to
congestion). These methods are classified into three categories: source
coding, channel coding, and joint source and channel methods. Source coding
refers to the methods implemented by the video codec. Channel coding refers to
the methods implemented by the networking layer. Joint source-channel refers
to methods that combine source-coding and network-coding mechanisms.

The H.264/AVC codec has several features that support error resilient
mechanisms for video communication that correspond to the above
categorization~\cite{310669}. At the codec level, the following are available:
adaptive slice size, Reference Picture Selection (RPS), and Flexible
Macroblock Ordering (FMO)~\cite{err_res_h264_std, wenger_ott_jscc}. Similarly,
at the channel level, the following are available: Selective Retransmission
(NACK), Packet Loss Indication (PLI). An example of joint source-channel is
Unequal Error Protection (UEP) with FEC~\cite{wang00review}, the sender
attempts to selectively protect important parts of the bitstream or by
encoding redundant pictures differently than other pictures \cite{ervcuupkp}.

The performance of the available error-resilience mechanisms vary with the
observed end-to-end latency, link loss, bandwidth constraints and operating
environment (3G/LTE to 3G/LTE, 3G/LTE to WLAN, or wireless to fixed, etc.). No
single error repair mechanism fits all operating environments. A solution that
works for an observed packet loss ratio of less than 2\%, may not scale well
for paths with higher packet loss or higher latency.

% The combination of end-to-end delay requirements, capacity constraints and
% varying packet loss rate require different error resilience mechanisms.

observing bit-error corruption.}
\label{fig:slicesize_mot}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}

  \item \textbf{\texttt{Retransmissions}}: In RTP, retransmissions are either
  payload-specific or at the transport-specific. Transport-specific loss
  contains packet loss information (Generic NACK), while payload-specific loss
  contains Slice Loss Information (SLI), Picture Loss Information (PLI) or
  Reference Picture Selection indication (RPS). Typically, the receiver
  detects a loss and sends it as soon as the RTCP reporting interval allows
  feedback.

  \item \textbf{\texttt{Adapting Slice Sizes}}: the encoder adapts the size of
  the picture slice based on the link characteristics; when the channel is
  lossless there can be one picture per slice or be the MTU size and when the
  high losses are reported, the slices are reduced in size (up to 100 bytes).
  Larger slice sizes improve encoding efficiency, but are more vulnerable to
  frame losses. Figure~\ref{fig:slicesize_mot} shows the variation of average
  PSNR with respect to different slice-sizes in varying loss scenarios. We
  observe, that there is direct correlation between packet loss and slice
  size.

  \item \textbf{\texttt{Reference Picture Selection}}: Instead of
  retransmitting the lost packet, the encoder finds the list of correctly
  received pictures by the decoder. Hence, for subsequent encodings, the
  encoder uses a different decoded picture for inter prediction reference.
  This method stops the temporal error propagation caused by an earlier packet
  loss. In the RPS message, the decoder either reports the list of pictures
  that were correctly received or lost. Hence, the encoder is able to retrieve
  the required picture loss data. The mode of operation can be decided
  depending on the observed packet loss rate.

  \item \textbf{\texttt{Unequal Error Protection}}: When the link latency is
  high, retransmissions cannot be used. In high latency networks, the
  retransmitted packets arrive too late to be played back. In these cases, the
  sender proactively uses a portion of the available capacity to send
  redundant packets (typically, FEC), hoping to recover any lost packet before
  decoding. Hence, by using UEP, the media senders try to strike a balance by
  protecting only a chosen set of the media packets. In \citepub{c:err}, we
  protect the reference frames and not the non-reference frames with UEP.

\end{itemize}

In \citepub{c:err}, we stream 3 different YUV sequences~\cite{YUV_seq} over a
3G link simulated in \emph{ns-2}~\cite{ns2} with varying amount of link layer
packet loss (0.5\%, 1.0\% and 1.5\%)~\cite{3gppSim}. Our experiments show that
using NACK, the endpoint is able to correct 15-30\% of the lost packets for an
end-to-end latency of 60ms (meeting the 150ms playout deadline). The number of
recovered packets will increase with shorter RTCP reporting intervals; in this
paper we use \emph{1s} reporting interval, with early and immediate reporting
as defined in \cite{rfc4585}. Based on these experiments, it shows that NACK
is an effective mechanism for low end-to-end latency scenarios. Similarly,
protecting the media flows with UEP incurred a 15-25\% overhead, and about
21-24\% of the lost packets were recovered.

\begin{figure}
\centerline {
\includegraphics[width=0.66\textwidth, 
    clip=true, trim=0cm 0cm 0cm 2.5cm]{chap6-graph-ssa_adapt}
}
\caption{The plot shows the variation in slice sizes with varying error
rates.}
\label{fig:ssa_adapt}
\end{figure}

Senders use a moving average of the last three observed fraction loss rate
reported in the RTCP RR to vary the slice size. The slice size is doubled for
every period with average loss below 1.0\% until it reaches the MTU size
(1500 bytes). Slice sizes remain constant for loss rates between 1\% to 2.5\%
to provide stability to the receiving system. However, In high loss scenarios,
if the slice size is larger than 400 bytes, it is halved and for sizes below
400 bytes, it is reduced in steps of 50 bytes to a minimum of 150 bytes. The
Figure ~\ref{fig:ssa_adapt} shows variation of slice-size with the
instantaneous loss rate and the average loss rate. Hence, by adapting the
slice sizes, the sender is not repairing the stream (or replacing the missing
packets), rather it is attempting to constrain the area of errors in the
picture. If an RTP packet containing a small sized slice is lost, a smaller
area of the decoded picture is affected, alternatively, when a packet
containing a large sized slice is lost, a large or complete decoded picture is
affected.

Lastly, using RPS error-resilience mechanism, the receiver indicates the
decoding correctness; when losses occur, which pictures or slices have been
decoded correctly or incorrectly. The feedback messages is encapsulated in an
RTCP packet and are reported to the sender. In our experiments, the receiver
reports RTCP every 250ms and it approximately consumes 2\% of the session
media rate. In Figure ~\ref{fig:rpsi_sim} (a), (b) and (c) we observe that the
PSNR drops down when a lost frame is referenced and the PSNR increases
immediately after the encoder chooses a correct reference picture. When the
one-way latency is 100 ms and the frame rate is set to 15 frames per second,
we observe the error propagation is stopped by RPS in about 4 to 7 pictures.

Table~\ref{tab:err-sch-psnr} presents the average PSNR of the different error
resilience schemes for links with 0.5\% fractional loss. We observe that the
RPS performs better than UEP and NACK and is comparable to adaptive slices.
The UEP underperforms mainly because the media stream is encoded at a lower
rate to make room for FEC, compared to the media streams of the other
error-resilience mechanisms.

In \citepub{c:err}, we model the error-resilience mechanisms as a function of
observed packet loss and end-to-end delay (or latency) and
Figure~\ref{fig:apply_err} summarizes the applicability of the
error-resilience mechanisms based on our experiments. NACK is useful when loss
rates are low and the end-to-end delay is also low. Adaptive slice size (SSA)
is applicable to the whole operational region because it attempts to scale the
packet size based on the observed loss rate, but does not help in packet
repair. RPS works better on links with bursty packet loss, where NACK would
not be effective. By correctly choosing a new reference picture, the sender is
more effective when network latency is higher. UEP/FEC is mainly useful when
the sender and receiver cannot effectively co-operate to repair the stream and
the fractional loss is within the FEC's chosen protection range.

\section{Using FEC for Congestion Control}

For many years, conversational multimedia flows have used Forward Error
Correction (FEC) for error protection~\cite{855913, 664283}, i.e., the
application trades-off additional sending rate for redundant packets to reduce
the effect of losses. In \citepub{c:err}, we show that 21-24\% of the lost
packets are recovered using a static amount of FEC. In \citepub{c:fecrc}, we
investigate the use of FEC packets not only for error-resilience but also as a
probing mechanism for congestion control.

Zhu~\textit{et al.}\cite{Zhu:2001tu,springerlink:1022865704606} propose using
Unequal Loss Protection (ULP) for both congestion control and
error-resilience. Firstly, they estimate the available rate using a variant of
TFRC, called Multimedia Streaming TCP-Friendly Protocol (MSTFP)~\cite{871542}.
Secondly, they take packet loss and historical sending rate to smooth out the
encoding rate. Lastly, they apply FEC while performing congestion control and
their results show a significant increase in PSNR. MSTFP on the other hand
does not use RTP/RTCP and acknowledges each packet for calculating the TFRC
estimate.

Our concept in \citepub{c:err} is similar to that described in
\cite{Zhu:2001tu} but applied to interactive multimedia. The concept is as
follows, the sender chooses a high FEC rate to aggressively probe for
available capacity and conversely chooses a low FEC rate to conservatively
probe for available capacity. While probing, if a packet is lost and the if
the FEC packet arrives in time for decoding, the receiver is be able to
recover the lost packet; if no packet is lost, the sender can increase the
media encoding rate by swapping out the FEC. Figure~\ref{fig:fecrc-intro}(a)
shows the endpoint adding FEC and then swapping it for additional media. This
method can be especially useful when the sending rate is close to the
bottleneck link rate, because by choosing an appropriate FEC rate the endpoint
is able to probe for available capacity without affecting the user-experience
because during the probing interval the media stream rate remains constant.

\caption{a) Interaction of FEC and congestion control, b) FEC-Based Rate
Adaptation (FBRA) state machine }
\label{fig:fecrc-intro}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:fecrc-intro}(a) illustrates the state machine of a
congestion-control algorithm incorporating FEC. The state machine includes 4
states: \texttt{\textbf{STAY}}, \texttt{\textbf{PROBE}}, \texttt{\textbf{UP}},
and \texttt{\textbf{DOWN}}. The congestion control monitors the congestion
cues (such as, RTT, packet loss or discard rate, jitter, frame inter-arrival
delay variation, ECN, etc.) to stay in the current state, or transit to
another. The state machine specifies only generic description of path
conditions for the transition between states and leaves the interpretation to
the underlying congestion control algorithm.

After enabling FEC for an interval, one of the following three conditions may
occur: 1) No more bandwidth is available, the sender keeps the current sending
rate (\texttt{\textbf{STAY state}}). 2) Stable conditions are detected, the
sender increases the sending rate and disables FEC (\texttt{\textbf{UP
state}}), and 3) Unstable conditions are detected, and the sender reduces the
sending rate \texttt{\textbf{DOWN state}}. If FEC is disabled for the last two
intervals and no change in path characteristics is observed, FEC is enabled
(\texttt{\textbf{PROBE state}})

In \citepub{c:fecrc}, we compare the performance of FEC-Based Rate Adaptation
(FBRA), RRTCC and C-NADU. The bottleneck link capacity varies between 100 and
256 \emph{kbps}. In the scenario, we evaluate the reactivity and convergence
of the rate-control algorithm to the available end-to-end capacity for
different path latencies.

Our simulations in \emph{ns-2}~\cite{ns2} shows that for the 50\emph{ms} and
100\emph{ms} bottleneck link latency, the goodput achieved by FBRA is
comparable to RRTCC but with comparatively lower loss rates ($\approx$1.5\%,
see Table~\ref{table:fecrc-var-res}). Figures~\ref{fig:fecrc-var}(a)--(b) show
that the FBRA can quite quickly bounce-back after undershooting. The figure
also shows that the FEC probing rate increases when the FBRA ramps up and the
FEC rate is low or disabled when the FBRA undershoots. However, FBRA is
primarily a delay-based control algorithm and for the 240\emph{ms} bottleneck
delay, it observes that the packets are arriving very close to application
defined maximum delay ($\approx$400ms) and is therefore, conservative in its
probing for available bandwidth (this is observed by the low FEC rate in
Figure~\ref{fig:fecrc-var}(c)). FEC rate is about 10\% of the media rate at
about 15-20 \emph{kbps} and the packet loss recovery is around 30\%. Compared
to FBRA, RRTCC tries to achieve high throughput at the cost of incurring
packet losses (this behavior is also observed in \ref{tab:rrtcc-loss}), while
C-NADU trades-off throughput for packet loss. Hence, FBRA nicely sits between
the two trade-offs.

% RRTCC achieves the best goodput ($169$-$180 kbps$) for the three bottleneck
% link latencies, but has the worst loss rate ($3$-$4\%$). RRTCC is aggressive
% in its probing for available bandwidth and does not react to losses up to
% $2\%$. On the other hand, C-NADU achieves excellent reliability
% ($0.15$-$0.5\%$) results in all the cases, but observes lower goodput (about
% $10$-$15kbps$ lower than RRTCC). The two algorithms trade-off throughput for
% packet loss and vice-versa.
