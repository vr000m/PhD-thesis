Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is suitable for multimedia communication
(voice-over-IP, video conferencing, telepresence systems), multimedia
streaming (video-on-demand, live streaming), media multicast and broadcast.
RTP and the corresponding feedback messages, RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) are
defined in~\cite{rfc3550}. RTP carries

RTP transmits the media data over IP using a variety of transport layer
protocols such as UDP, TCP, and Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP).
Consequetly, congestion control for RTP media flows can be implemented either
in the application or the media flows are transmitted over congestion-
controlled transport (TCP or DCCP). While using a congestion controlled
transport may be safe for the network, it is suboptimal for the media quality
unless the congestion-controlled transport is designed to carry media flows.
