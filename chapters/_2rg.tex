%Enabling adaptive multimedia applications/systems.

The research goal of this thesis is to discuss congestion control for real-
time media. To achieve a suitable end-user experience, a multimedia
system\footnote{the transmitting endpoint or a classifier in the network} can
associate a DiffServ Code Point (DSCP) to the media packets; therby, enabling
Quality of Service (QoS). Or it can modify the media encoding quality to the
available path capacity.
