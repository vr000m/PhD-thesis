%Enabling adaptive multimedia applications/systems.

The research goal of this thesis is to discuss congestion control for real-
time media. To achieve a suitable end-user experience, a multimedia
system\footnote{the transmitting endpoint or a classifier in the network} can:
1) associate a DiffServ Code Point (DSCP) to the media packets; therby,
enabling Quality of Service (QoS). Using DSCP poses some challenges, which are
discussed in Section~\ref{rg.ch.dscp}. 2) instruct the encoder to modify the
encoding rate to a certain target rate. To achieve media rate-adaption the
endpoint needs to monitor and respond to congestion cues. Additionally, we 
discuss requirements for implementing media rate-adaptation.
